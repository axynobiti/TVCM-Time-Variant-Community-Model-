This repository implements the Time-Variant Community Model (TVCM) and its Social-Overlay (SO) extension to reproduce bridging-link behavior as described in 
"Putting Contacts into Context: Mobility Modeling beyond Inter-Contact Times"
By Theus Hossmann, Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos, Franck Legendre ,Communication Systems Group, ETH Zürich, Switzerland; Mobile Communications, EURECOM, France.

The SO module synchronizes meetings of nodes from different communities outside their home locations, creating narrow, strong inter-community ties which reflect better an aspect of the nature of human mobility.

In real human mobility we don’t just bump into people at random , we routinely make synchronized, co-located meetings with members of our social circle outside of our “home” base, and these gatherings often produce the critical bridges that knit different communities together
