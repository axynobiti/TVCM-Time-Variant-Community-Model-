This repository implements the Time-Variant Community Model (TVCM) and its Social-Overlay (SO) extension to reproduce bridging-link behavior as described in 
"Putting Contacts into Context: Mobility Modeling beyond Inter-Contact Times"
By Theus Hossmann, Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos, Franck Legendre ,Communication Systems Group, ETH ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland; Mobile Communications, EURECOM, France.

The SO module synchronizes meetings of nodes from different communities outside their home locations, creating narrow, strong inter-community ties which reflect better an aspect of the nature of human mobility.
